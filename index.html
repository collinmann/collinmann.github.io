									<h2>My Experience in Education</h2>
									<p>I've grown up in the education system. I am the product of the around 60+ different teachers I've had throughout my education, not to mention the things I've learned from people who aren't "teachers." I also plan to continue further into education as a teacher, giving this particular subject even more special meaning to myself.</p>

									<h2>What's wrong with Education?</h2>
									<p>It isn't my place to make blanket statements about what could be "wrong" with education. The aim of these media sources and my prject is merely to offer up different perspectives on education. What I want to make most clear is that the claims myself or my groupmates make are purely from our own experience, and fueled by our connections to education. Education isn't all bad and I in no way want people to think that is the stance I am taking; below I've linked a website that shares some of the really good things going on with education!</p>

							<h2>Media Sources</h2>
							<p>Throughout my fall 2018 semester in Writing and Digital Media, my groupmates and myself have compiled information regarding Education, its current state, and the different perceptions of education (including our own) and I have linked these below.</p>
